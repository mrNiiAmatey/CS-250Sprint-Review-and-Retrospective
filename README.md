//The interpretation and implementation of user needs is derived from a well written and comprehensive user story. A program can take less time to complete if the user story documented by the Product owner has no flaws and can be comprehended by the developer easily. Of course, creating user stories definitely helps in the creation of codes. I approach developing programs by using agile estimation practices such as Story points. The agile approach to developing programs helps to reduce my planning time, predict release dates more accurately and the end-product mostly comes with high quality. My hope is to keep incorporating the same process into my future development work. Finally, to be a good team simply means that you criticize ideas not people, pursuing technical excellence should be your top priority, know your customer and you should be willing to fix dependencies and impediments with other team members.
